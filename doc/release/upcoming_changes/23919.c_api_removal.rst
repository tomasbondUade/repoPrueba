* ``npy_interrupt.h`` and the corresponding macros like ``NPY_SIGINT_ON``
  have been removed.  We recommend querying ``PyErr_CheckSignals()`` or
  ``PyOS_InterruptOccurred()`` periodically.  (These do currently require
  holding the GIL though).
* The ``noprefix.h`` header has been removed, replace missing symbols with
  their prefixed counterparts (usually an added ``NPY_`` or ``npy_``).
