Integer sequences as the ``shape`` argument for `np.memmap`
-----------------------------------------------------------
`np.memmap` can now be created with any integer sequence as the ``shape`` 
argument, such as a list or numpy array of integers. Previously, only the 
types of tuple and int could be used without raising an error.
