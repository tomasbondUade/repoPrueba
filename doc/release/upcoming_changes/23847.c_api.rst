Const correctness for the generalized ufunc C API
-------------------------------------------------
The Numpy C API's functions for constructing generalized ufuncs
(``PyUFunc_FromFuncAndData``, ``PyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignature``,
``PyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignatureAndIdentity``) take ``types`` and ``data``
arguments that are not modified by Numpy's internals. Like the ``name`` and
``doc`` arguments, third-party Python extension modules are likely to supply
these arguments from static constants. The ``types`` and ``data`` arguments are
now const-correct: they are declared as ``const char *types`` and
``void *const *data``, respectively. C code should not be affected, but C++
code may be.
