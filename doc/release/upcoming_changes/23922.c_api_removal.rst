* ``PyUFunc_GetPyVals``, ``PyUFunc_handlefperr``, and ``PyUFunc_checkfperr``
  have been removed.
  If needed, a new backwards compatible function to raise floating point errors
  could be restored.  (There are no known users and the functions would have made
  ``with np.errstate()`` fixes much more difficult.)
